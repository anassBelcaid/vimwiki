#Compter Vision#

I dream to become an expert on *Computer vision*. So I diceded, as a starting
step, to finish a hard but fair course. I followed several of them including

* [https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810](Udacity introduction to computer vision)

* [ https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/teaching/2019Fall/CSC420.html]( Sanja : Understanding Images )

But Now I'm following the **MIT** advance course
[http://6.869.csail.mit.edu/fa19/schedule.html](MIT.6.869) which is more
directed to learning and researcher.

## CS 6.69
