A 3D rotation matrix can be formed as the product of **three** rotation matrices
around the axis $x, y,$ and $z$. This is a bad idea, as we must remember the
order for the multiplications. Also, small changes in 3D rotations, could lead a
substantial changes in those elementary matrices.

### Axis/angle (Exponential twist)
A rotation can be represented by a rotation axis $\hat{n}$ and an angle
$\theta$ or equivalently by a 3D vector $w\theta \hat{n}$. In order to compute
this rotation we first project the vector v  into the axis $\hat{n}$.

{{$
v_{||} = \hat{n}(\hat{n}.v) = (\hat(n)\hat{n}^T).v
$}}

#### Cross product matrix:

{{$
[n]_{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 
0  & -n_z & n_y\\
n_z &  0 &  -n_x\\
n_y & n_x &  0
\end{pmatrix}
$}}


Once we defined the cross product matrix, we could write the rotation matrix $R$
around theta as

{{$
R(n, \theta) = I  + sin(\theta)[n]_{x} + (1-cos(\theta))[n]_{x}^2
$}}

which knows as the _Rodriguz_ formula.
